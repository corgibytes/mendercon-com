question: "Will my session be recorded?"
---

With the [platform](https://hopin.to/events/mendercon-2021) that we’re using, this is something that is decided when 
the session is created. If the session’s organizer would like it to be recorded, then we leave that decision up to them. 
We can imagine it may be useful to have conversations that are not being recorded. We do plan on recording and sharing 
the keynote and the pitch session.
