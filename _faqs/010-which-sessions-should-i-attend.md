question: "What do I do if I'm not sure which session to attend?"
---

During each of the session rounds, there are going to be several different sessions going on at once, and it may be
difficult to decide which session is the best one for you. The Open Space community employs the “Rule of Two Feet” to
specify that you can leave a session at any time and join a session at any time. If you feel you’re in the wrong
session, then switch to a different one. Don’t feel obligated to stay in a session for the full time just because you
were there when it started. And similarly, don’t be afraid to join a session after it’s started.
