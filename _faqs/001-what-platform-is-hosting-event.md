question: "What platform is being used to host the event? Why?"
---

The event will be hosted on [Hopin](https://hopin.to/events/mendercon-2021). We feel that it is built for exactly the 
kind of event we want to have. It allows participants to easily create session, attend session, and move from one 
session to another if they didnâ€™t like the one they find themselves in. It also has support for virtual vendor booths 
and randomized one-on-one networking sessions. This is our first time running an event using Hopin, and we're excited 
to see how it goes!
