question: "What platform is being used to host the event? Why?"
---

The event will be hosted on [Hopin](https://hopin.to/events/mendercon-2022). We feel that it is built for exactly the
kind of event we want to have. It allows participants to easily create session, attend session, and move from one
session to another if they didnâ€™t like the one they find themselves in. It also has support for virtual vendor booths
and randomized one-on-one networking sessions. We used it for our first ever MenderCon and really enjoyed it!
