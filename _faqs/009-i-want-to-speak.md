question: "What do I do if I want to speak? Is there a CFP?"

You have two options: You can [apply to speak](https://mendercon.com/speakers/) on the standard event track, or you can come to the “pitch session” for the unconference track.  At the pitch session we’ll invite
anyone who wants to organize a session up onto the virtual stage. There, they’ll briefly announce their session title
along with a short description and the time that the session is scheduled to happen.
