                We had our first MenderCon in 2020 and the experience was something we will never forget!
                    It quickly solidified in our hearts that we had to make this a recurring event. Don't believe
                    us? Here is what previous attendees had to say!

                <h5>What People Are Saying</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>I learned a lot and was able to personally connect with some of my heroes in the industry!</li>
                    <li>Great discussions!</li>
                    <li>I really enjoyed the open-space format. I got to meet a lot of really smart and awesome developers
                        and gain some insights into the legacy code I'm actively working with.</li>
                    <li>I loved being able to wonder around and meet
                        people in different rooms. I also liked the five minute meetups with random people. There were some good
                        sessions and I loved the topic.</li>
                    <li>Great small group conversations resulting in ideas that I was able to implement with my team.</li>
                    <li>Your open meetings have given me a community I did not know I was
                        missing because I mainly see myself as an innovator, but with a big love and respect for decades old
                        software still being really valuable.</li>
                    <li>I found interesting discussions. I really liked the virtual format which made it possible for me to attend.</li>
                    <li>It was my first open space conference and, as most people (I assume), I was skeptical about the format
                       but was surprised how well it worked.</li>
                    <li>Subject interesting and people awesome! Loved the followup mail we received
                       with all the links!</li>
                </ul>
