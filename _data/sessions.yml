  title: "Decommissioning a legacy module progressively, using AST traversal"
  description: |
    <p>Somewhere, deeply hidden in an old codebase, a module has become so buggy and nasty that no developer dares making any change to it. Actually, developers want to get rid of it, but a big part of the codebase is indirectly relying on it...</p>

    <p>Can this story resolve to a happy ending? How to prevent the situation from getting worse, while developers keep adding features in the codebase?</p>

    <p>What if AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) traversal was the key? Let's see how it can help us keep an eye on these dependencies, and prune them one by one, until the module is gone for good! ðŸ˜Œ</p>
